# "Upload a File with Python Flask"


My assignment is to create a flask backend for receiving a csv file via post request. 

## main.py
See https://pythonbasics.org/flask-upload-file/  File uploading is a common task in web apps. In this tutorial you learn how to do that with Python Flask. It is very simple to upload the file upload in the Flask file by the Flask file. For more instructions, follow the link above...

## app.py
Just playing around. Part of a hackathon. Further research and reading is needed to find a suitable app and/or code it in a well-founded way.
